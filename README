The idea for this plugin comes from a simple insight I had:
1) Lots of websites look horrible for no good reason
2) Twitter Bootstrap makes pages look better with little effort

So I went around with the chrome inspector injecting a link to Twitter Bootstrap on to a number of bad looking pages… and bam they looked better. So I wrote up a simple plugin to make my life easier.

Some sites to give it a try on:
- Craigslist Apartments for rent page: http://sfbay.craigslist.org/apa/
- I-80 Road Conditions in Wyoming: http://www.wyoroad.info/pls/Browse/WRR.RoutesResults?SelectedRoute=I80&Sensors=Sensors&Webcameras=Webcameras
- Hacker News: http://news.ycombinator.com/
